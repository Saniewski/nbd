# NBD - LAB05
A repository for uploading non-relational databases (NBD) class assignments at PJAIT. This readme addresses the 5th assignment.

## Installation

To install a riak-kv instance, navigate to `lab05` directory and use docker-compose.yaml file with the following command:
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Importing data

This assignment does not require importing any example data.

After succesfully creating and running the riak-kv container, head straight to the `zapytania.sh` script and run the `curl` commands!

## Running

Just copy the corresponding query and paste it into the shell console of your choice (you have to have `curl` command installed).
